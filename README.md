# Whoyp (What happens on your phone)

People like to take pictures that should not be leaked to the Internet. That will probably never change. People will also share these pictures with the intent that they're only viewed by the right person. 

How ever, we know that when storing thing online images can be leaked, accounts hacked or just by revenge thet get shared. 

With this app I intent to do what I can to minimize the risks of taking and sharing pictures that are intended to be private. 

## Here's the idea

* Encrypt locally stored images on device
* Use FaceId / TouchId so only decrypt images when app is active and unlocked
* For sharing, use public / private keys and encrypt image with recipients public key before sharing
* Sharing is only allowed over a pier to pier connection when phones are in psysical proximity to each other
* Keys must have been exchange before sharing can occur
* Avoid ability to screenshot images

## Limitations
I am by no means an expert in cyber security and encryption. This will be a learning excercise. I'm making this public so other can review my code and point out all the places I can do better.
